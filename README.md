Here is my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided.

# Dataset
The dataset used for the task is [test.csv](test.csv)

# Tools and Libraries Used: 
* Jupyter notebook
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

  # Data Cleaning And Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:
1. Sorted Data : Sorted data from the top and bottom.

2. Data Cleaning: Checked for null values, missing values, and duplicates in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

3. Visualization: Created a bar chart, for the Age distribution and count.

# Knowledge Gained 
I learned how to clean text data, turn it into numbers, and build a model to find spam messages. I also improved my skills in organizing projects and checking how well the model works.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
